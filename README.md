## Description

- This Webpage allows those who visit the chance to get a look inside what I am capable of. 

- This site was built to help me start a Webpage from scratch, nothing but an empty screen, it was a challenge but I believe it's good work.

- This challenge helped me understand how to start writing code from scratch, how to apply different CSS styles and how to make them work together.
